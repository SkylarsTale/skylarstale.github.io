    <h5 style="color:white">"The Astral Express! I can see it on the horizon!" Asta said, smiling.<br>"I can't wait to get on!" April said.<br>"What's that dot over there?" Asta cried, pointing to a small dot, slowly increasing in size.<br>"It's a comet!" April said. As the dot came closer, the two girls realised it wasn't a comet, but a girl, hurtling towards the station.<br><br>She lay there. On the metal.<br>"Hello?" Asta said, trying to be as slow and as clear as she could be.<br>The girl groaned.<br>"Who are you?" she asked.<br>"I'm Asta," Asta said. "Wait a second." She tapped her wrist a few times, and while she tapped, April said, <br>"Your mental state is being temporarily ajusted to calm you. Please remain calm."<br>"April!" Asta said, sternly."Her name is Skylar. She's 16 years old, my age."<br>"Wow, big sis! How do you know all of that?" April asked. <br>"She's not human. She's a hologram. Hard light." Asta said.<br>"Now what do we do?" April asked.</h5>
